# AI Search Algorithm Toolkit (Python)

This project provides a clean, modular Python implementation of foundational AI search algorithms (DFS, BFS, UCS, and A*) for an Artificial Intelligence course. It is designed to be a flexible toolkit capable of solving problems defined by an abstract `Problem` class, with a concrete example provided for solving grid-based mazes.

## Features

* **Modular Design:** Algorithms are decoupled from the problem definition.
* **Generic Algorithms:** Clean implementations of:
    * Depth First Search (DFS)
    * Breadth First Search (BFS)
    * Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
    * A\* Search (AStar)
* **Concrete Example:** A `MazeProblem` class that parses `.txt` files.
* **Heuristics:** Includes a sample `manhattanHeuristic` for A\*.
* **Command-Line Interface:** A `main.py` script using `argparse` to easily run any algorithm on any maze.

## AI & CS Concepts Showcased

* **Problem Abstraction:** Use of Abstract Base Classes (`abc.ABC`) to define a formal `Problem` interface (`getStartState`, `isGoalState`, `getSuccessors`).
* **Search Algorithms:** Implementation of uninformed (DFS, BFS) and informed (UCS, A\*) graph search algorithms.
* **Data Structures:** Practical application of Stacks, Queues, and Priority Queues (`heapq`) as the "fringe" for different search strategies.
* **Heuristics:** Understanding the role of a heuristic function ($h(n)$) in A\* and implementing the admissible and consistent Manhattan distance heuristic.
* **State-Space Search:** The entire project is a classic example of state-space search, including managing a `visited` set to avoid cycles.
* **Software Design:** Clean, modular code separated into `problem`, `search`, and `utils` components.

## How It Works

The system is built on a few core components:

### 1. The `Problem` Interface (`src/problem.py`)

This abstract class defines the "contract" for a search problem. Any problem (like a maze, 8-puzzle, etc.) must provide three methods: `getStartState()`, `isGoalState(state)`, and `getSuccessors(state)`.

### 2. Utility Data Structures (`src/utils.py`)

This file contains the `Stack` (for DFS), `Queue` (for BFS), and `PriorityQueue` (for UCS/A\*) classes that the search algorithms use to manage the "fringe" (the set of nodes to be explored).

### 3. The `MazeProblem` (`src/maze_problem.py`)

This is a concrete implementation of the `Problem` interface.
* Its `__init__` method reads a `.txt` file, parsing it into a grid, and identifying walls (`%`), the start (`S`), and the goal (`G`).
* `getSuccessors(state)` returns valid moves (North, South, East, West) from the current `(row, col)` state that are not walls.
* This file also contains the `manhattanHeuristic` function, which is passed to A\* to guide its search.

### 4. The Search Algorithms (`src/search.py`)

This is the core of the project. Each function (`depthFirstSearch`, `breadthFirstSearch`, etc.) is a generic algorithm that takes a `Problem` object as input. It knows nothing about mazes, only about states, goals, and successors. This is what makes the toolkit modular.

### 5. The Main Executable (`main.py`)

This script ties everything together.
1.  It uses `argparse` to read user input from the command line (the maze file path and the algorithm to use).
2.  It instantiates a `MazeProblem` object using the file.
3.  It calls the correct search function from `src/search.py`.
4.  It prints the solution, path length, and execution time.

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/msmrexe/python-ai-search-toolkit.git
    cd python-ai-search-toolkit
    ```

2.  **Run an Algorithm:**
    The `main.py` script is used to run the searches. The basic syntax is:
    `python main.py <path_to_maze_file> --algorithm <algorithm_name>`

    **Example (A\*):**
    ```bash
    python main.py data/maze_medium.txt -a a_star
    ```
    *Output:*
    ```
    Loading maze from: data/maze_medium.txt
    Solving using A_STAR...
    ------------------------------
    ðŸŽ‰ Solution Found! ðŸŽ‰
    Path: South -> South -> ... -> East -> East
    Path Length: 58 steps
    Time elapsed: 0.001967 seconds
    ------------------------------
    ```

    **Example (BFS):**
    ```bash
    python main.py data/maze_medium.txt -a bfs
    ```
    *Output:*
    ```
    Loading maze from: data/maze_medium.txt
    Solving using BFS...
    ------------------------------
    ðŸŽ‰ Solution Found! ðŸŽ‰
    Path: South -> South -> ... -> East -> East
    Path Length: 58 steps
    Time elapsed: 0.002980 seconds
    ------------------------------
    ```

    **Example (No Solution):**
    ```bash
    python main.py data/maze_no_solution.txt -a dfs
    ```
    *Output:*
    ```
    Loading maze from: data/maze_no_solution.txt
    Solving using DFS...
    ------------------------------
    ðŸ’” No solution found.
    Time elapsed: 0.000100 seconds
    ------------------------------
    ```
